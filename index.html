                    <h4>Plumber</h4>
                    <p>It happens quietly and swiftly when you find plumbing or any leakage issue. It takes a few
                      hours
                      for this minor issue to take the shape of the problem. That can hamper the daily routine of a
                      house. This makes you compromise with your schedule and invest time in finding a reliable
                      plumber.
                      Even if you finally find one, you will be concerned with the reasonable rate and the plumber’s
                      expertise.</p>
                    <p>Years of training and/or experience are needed to become a skilled plumber; some jurisdictions
                      also require that plumbers be licensed.

                      Common plumbing tasks and skills include:

                      Reading drawings and specifications, to determine the layout of water supply, waste, and venting
                      systems
                      Detecting faults in plumbing appliances and systems, and correctly diagnosing their causes
                      Installing, repairing and maintaining domestic, commercial, and industrial plumbing fixtures and
                      systems
                      Locating and marking positions for pipe connections, passage holes, and fixtures in walls and
                      floors
                      Measuring, cutting, bending, and threading pipes using hand and power tools or machines
                      Joining pipes and fittings together using soldering techniques, compression fittings, threaded
                      fittings, and push-on fittings.
                      Testing pipes for leaks using air and water pressure gauges
                      Paying attention, in all work undertaken, to legal regulations and safety issues
                      Ensuring that all safety standards and building regulations are met.</p>

                    <h4>Electricall</h4>
                    <p>An electrician is a tradesman specializing in electrical wiring of buildings, transmission
                      lines,
                      stationary machines, and related equipment. Electricians may be employed in the installation of
                      new electrical components or the maintenance and repair of existing electrical
                      infrastructure.[1]
                      Electricians may also specialize in wiring ships, airplanes, and other mobile platforms, as well
                      as data and cable lines.For other uses, see Electricity (disambiguation).

                      Electricity is the set of physical phenomena associated with the presence and motion of matter
                      that has a property of electric charge. Electricity is related to magnetism, both being part of
                      the phenomenon of electromagnetism, as described by Maxwell's equations. Various common
                      phenomena
                      are related to electricity, including lightning, static electricity, electric heating, electric
                      discharges and many others.

                      The presence of an electric charge, which can be either positive or negative, produces an
                      electric
                      field. The movement of electric charges is an electric current and produces a magnetic field.

                      When a charge is placed in a location with a non-zero electric field, a force will act on it.
                      The
                      magnitude of this force is given by Coulomb's law. If the charge moves, the electric field would
                      be doing work on the electric charge. Thus we can speak of electric potential at a certain point
                      in space, which is equal to the work done by an external agent in carrying a unit of positive
                      charge from an arbitrarily chosen reference point to that point without any acceleration and is
                      typically measured in volts.</p>

                    <h4>Painter</h4>
                    <p>This article is about artistic painting. For other uses, see Painting (disambiguation).
                      "Painter" redirects here. For other uses, see Painter (disambiguation).

                      The Mona Lisa (1503-1517) by Leonardo da Vinci is one of the world's most recognizable
                      paintings.

                      An artistic depiction of a group of rhinos was made in the Chauvet Cave 30,000 to 32,000 years
                      ago.
                      Painting is the practice of applying paint, pigment, color or other medium to a solid surface
                      (called the "matrix" or "support").[1] The medium is commonly applied to the base with a brush,
                      but other implements, such as knives, sponges, and airbrushes, can be used.

                      In art, the term painting describes both the act and the result of the action (the final work is
                      called "a painting"). The support for paintings includes such surfaces as walls, paper, canvas,
                      wood, glass, lacquer, pottery, leaf, copper and concrete, and the painting may incorporate
                      multiple other materials, including sand, clay, paper, plaster, gold leaf, and even whole
                      objects.

                      Painting is an important form in the visual arts, bringing in elements such as drawing,
                      composition, gesture (as in gestural painting), narration (as in narrative art), and abstraction
                      (as in abstract art).[2] Paintings can be naturalistic and representational (as in still life
                      and
                      landscape painting), photographic, abstract, narrative, symbolistic (as in Symbolist art),
                      emotive
                      (as in Expressionism) or political in nature (as in Artivism).

                    <h4>CARPENTER</h4>
                    <p>Carpentry is a skilled trade and a craft in which the primary work performed is the cutting,
                      shaping and installation of building materials during the construction of buildings, ships,
                      timber
                      bridges, concrete formwork, etc. Carpenters traditionally worked with natural wood and did
                      rougher
                      work such as framing, but today many other materials are also used[1] and sometimes the finer
                      trades of cabinetmaking and furniture building are considered carpentry. In the United States,
                      98.5% of carpenters are male, and it was the fourth most male-dominated occupation in the
                      country
                      in 1999. In 2006 in the United States, there were about 1.5 million carpentry positions.
                      Carpenters are usually the first tradesmen on a job and the last to leave.[2] Carpenters
                      normally
                      framed post-and-beam buildings until the end of the 19th century; now this old-fashioned
                      carpentry
                      is called timber framing. Carpenters learn this trade by being employed through an
                      apprenticeship
                      training—normally 4 years—and qualify by successfully completing that country's competence test
                      in
                      places such as the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada, Switzerland, Australia and South
                      Africa.[3] It is also common that the skill can be learned by gaining work experience other than
                      a
                      formal training program, which may be the case in many places.</p>
